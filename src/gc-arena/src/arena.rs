/// for any held `Gc` pointer types.

/// ```
/// # use gc_arena::{Collect, Gc, make_arena};
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// #[derive(Collect)]

/// Garbage collected arenas allow for isolated sets of garbage collected objects with zero-overhead
/// garbage collected pointers.  It provides incremental mark and sweep garbage collection which
/// must be manually triggered outside the `mutate` method, and works best when units of work inside
/// `mutate` can be kept relatively small.  It is designed primarily to be a garbage collector for
/// scripting language runtimes.
///
/// The arena API is able to provide extremely cheap Gc pointers because it is based around
/// "generativity".  During construction and access, the root type is branded by a unique, invariant
/// lifetime `'gc` which ensures that `Gc` pointers must be contained inside the root object
/// hierarchy and cannot escape the arena callbacks or be smuggled inside another arena.  This way,
/// the arena can be sure that during mutation, all `Gc` pointers come from the arena we expect them
/// to come from, and that they're all either reachable from root or have been allocated during the
/// current `mutate` call.  When not inside the `mutate` callback, the arena knows that all `Gc`
/// pointers must be either reachable from root or they are unreachable and safe to collect.  In
/// this way, incremental garbage collection can be achieved (assuming "sufficiently small" calls to
/// `mutate`) that is both extremely safe and zero overhead vs what you would write in C with raw
/// pointers and manually ensuring that invariants are held.
